    for instance, list item is like-array not a REAL ARRAY
    if you console.log it, you will se NodeList
    NodeList is example of like-array

    Find single item inside of nested array
    BUT you have to be careful and concern all of that data must be nested array
    because we loop it through inside of that nested array
    is there is a single item and not inside of nested array, the loop
    will broken and throw an error.

    What does mean?
    see this example:
    const analyticData = {
        [1, 1.5],
        [-5.5, 2.1],
        5
    }

    that code above will throw an error, because we have a single value that not inside
    of a nested array.

/*
    concat method
    concat method will combine two or more array, slightly like push method but there is huge different
    between concat and push.
    push will add a new item into the array at the end of array BUT ONLY COUNT AS A SINGLE ITEM.
    concat will combine two or more array and store it at the end of array and we can store
    AN ARRAY NOT A SINGLE ITEM.

    concat method will return a brand new array.

    see example:

/*
    indexOf() method.
    indexOf() method will search a match value and it will return as soon as possible
    when found the first match value.

    lastIndexOf() method.
    lastIndexOf() method can be very useful when you want to find the matchest element
    from last index, same like indexOf() it will return as soon as possible when found
    the first match value from the last index.

    those two methods ONLY WORK FOR PRIMITIVE VALUES, AND NOT GONNA WORK FOR REFERENCE VALUE
    if you try to find an index either first match or last match of the index at the reference value
    it always yield -1.

    Why always yield -1?
    because those method could find the match value you looking for and then it will
    always return -1.

    so, how to find the matches index if we using reference value? see below
*/

/*
    find() method
    find() method will yield predicate of value you looking for.
    find() method typically will use the anonymous function the execute the method.
    find() method can take up to three (3) arguments.
    1. a single object of the array (we can choose any name we want, typically singular)
    2. the index of that single element
    3. the full array (typically plural)

    and then who calling the anonymous function then?
    JavaScript will calling it automatically for us.

    it is like-create-a-new object because we can name the argument whaterver we want.

    find() method will return the object

    see example:
*/
const personData = [{ name: "Rhenaldo" }, { name: "Arya" }];
console.log(
  personData.find((person, idx, persons) => {
    return person.name === "Rhenaldo";
  })
);

/*
  result:
  { name: "Rhenaldo" }
*/

/*
  findIndex() method.
  simply return the index of the reference value we looking for.
*/
console.log(
  personData.findIndex((person, idx, persons) => {
    return person.name === "Arya";
  })
);

/*
  result:
  1
*/

/*
  find() and findIndex() IS CASE SENSITIVE.
  Always return -1 if not found the value we looking for.
*/

/*
  forEach() method.
  forEach() method ONLY AVAILABLE TO AN ARRAY.

  can we say, forEach() is replacement for for .. of loop.

  and just like find and findIndex will use anonymous function to execute the method.
  forEach() method can take up to three arguments same like find and findIndex method.
